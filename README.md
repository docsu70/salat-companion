Title: Rafiq-salat (salat companion)
Project Description: A react native app built in Replit with AI assistance.
App description: simple native mobile app that displays random Quran verses from lists that are customised by the user. 
The idea is that people tend to recite the same suras during daily prayers, the suras that always come to mind. 
This app helps them choose from all of the suras they have memorised and by doing so continually recite them which helps consolidate memory.
This app shows lists of short suras/verses, long suras/verses, and suggested ones. Each time the user clicks the button a random selection is displayed from each list
The user can customise the lists based on the suras/verses they have memorised or want to learn
